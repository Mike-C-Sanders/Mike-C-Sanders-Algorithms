# Mike-C-Sanders- Algorithm Practices
Algorithms and Datastructures are the fundamentals of a strong programmer. This repository is part of this life long persuit of mastery. 

This repository is meant to serve as a log and a central location for the algorithms I'm practicing.

## Current Algorithms

At this time QuickFind, UnionFind are the two primary algorithms created in this repository. More will be added as time goes on.

## Practice problems

The practice problems folder has a variety of problems related to different algoritms. The goal of this folder is to hold the different practice algorithms I create along the way. 

The 3Sum problem is included at the moment.
