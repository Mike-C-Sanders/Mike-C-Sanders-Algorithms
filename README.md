# Mike-C-Sanders- Algorithm/Data-Structure Practices
Algorithms and Datastructures are the fundamentals of a strong programmer. This repository is part of this life long persuit of mastery. 

This repository is meant to serve as a log and a central location for the algorithms and data-structures I'm practicing/working on. I'm including some of the problems that I've worked on using these Algs and DSs. 

## Current Algorithms

- QuickFind
- UnionFind
- BinarySearch

## Data-Structures

- Linked List: a few methods including insert node, insert last node, remove node, insert at index, and clear list.
- Stacks: push and pop methods. Really basic for practice.

## Practice problems

- 3Sum Problem (updated with brute force method and a revised version using BinarySearch BigO of n^2Logn)
- FizzBuzz
